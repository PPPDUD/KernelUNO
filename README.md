# Coconix
Coconix is a Unix-like shell for Arduino Uno boards.

## Compatibility
In this table, _yes_ denotes a board on which Coconix can make use of its full feature set, _partially_ denotes a board on which Coconix can provide limited functionality, and _no_ denotes a board that is unlikely to work with Coconix.
| Board    | Supported by Coconix? | Notes |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| Arduino UNO R3  | Yes    | N/A |
| Arduino UNO R4 | Yes     | EEPROM is emulated in flash on R4 boards.* |
| Arduino Due    | Partially    | Coconix on the Arduino Due cannot operate piezo buzzers or save data to non-volatile storage.* |
| Arduino GIGA R1    | Partially    | Coconix on the Arduino GIGA R1 cannot save data to non-volatile storage or check the amount of free memory.* |
| Adafruit Metro M0 Express    | Partially    | Coconix on the Adafruit Metro M0 Express cannot save data to non-volatile storage.* |
| Adafruit Feather 328p    | Yes**    | In order to prevent the serial I/O from being garbled, the `BAUD_RATE` macro must be set to 9600. |
| ESP32 family    | No    | Coconix on ESP32-family microcontrollers is untested and most likely broken. |


_*For more information on non-volatile storage support, read the FAQ at `EEPROM.md`._

_**This board requires special configuration changes to function properly with Coconix._

## A note about ArduinOS and KernelESP
Some may notice that the [ArduinOS](https://github.com/Chirrenthen/ArduinOS) and [KernelESP](https://github.com/Chirrenthen/KernelESP) projects have many of the same commands as Coconix.

ArduinOS and KernelESP are rewrites of the KernelUNO codebase with features adopted from then-unmerged pull requests, and they are not affiliated with the Coconix project in any way. In addition, all versions of the ArduinOS project predating [72062e7](https://github.com/Chirrenthen/ArduinOS/commit/72062e7c260762eae3c828dba2ad7a4a0d1d9bf4) contain portions of code derived from the copyrighted work of the authors of Coconix and KernelUNO, and which have an unclear copyright status.
